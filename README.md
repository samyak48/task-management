Here is the revised documentation with the added corrections and enhancements:

# React.js and Express.js with MySQL App

This is a sample application built using React.js for the frontend and Express.js with MySQL for the backend. It includes features such as user authentication, task management, and form validation.

## User Roles
- **Admin**: Create tasks for users.
- **User**: View and update tasks.

## Frontend (React.js)

### Frontend Guidelines
- Use any middleware for Redux (Saga / Thunk).
- Use Redux middleware for performing data manipulation, such as updating frontend data into valid API payload before sending requests to the server or restructuring data fetched from the API in Redux middleware before storing it in Redux.
- All API integration code should be written in Redux middleware.

### LoginForm Component
- Use separate routes for admin and user login.
- Create a new React component called "LoginForm" that includes a form with fields for username and password.
- Implement form validation for the "LoginForm" component. Display an error message if the username or password is empty.

## Admin Modules

### Admin Dashboard Component
- Create a new React component called "Dashboard" that displays the total tasks, pending tasks, total completed tasks, tasks completed today, and overdue tasks.
- Implement authentication using React Router. Create a private route that renders the "Dashboard" component only if the user is authenticated. Otherwise, redirect the user to the login page.

### Admin TaskList Component
- Create a React component called "TaskList" that fetches and displays a list of tasks from the backend.
- Add filters to the task table. Admin can filter tasks by username, task start date, task due date, and task status.
- Implement pagination for the task list.

### Admin CreateTaskForm Component
- Add functionality to create a new task.
- Create a React component called "CreateTaskForm" that includes fields for the task name, description, start date, due date, and assigned user.
- When the form is submitted, send a POST request to the backend to create the task for the specific user.

### Admin Updating and Deleting Tasks
- Implement updating and deleting tasks.
- For each task displayed in the "TaskList" component, add buttons to edit and delete the task.
- When the edit button is clicked, display the "CreateTaskForm" with the task's current details, allowing the admin to update the information.
- When the delete button is clicked, show a double confirmation dialog and send a DELETE request to the backend to delete the task.

## User Modules

### User Dashboard Component
- Create a new React component called "UserDashboard" that displays a task list for the specific user.
- On this page add filters of completed task and pending task, only those tasks whose start date is greater than or equal to the current date should be visible by for today's task and if task is marked as completed by user (using dropdown) those tasks will be visible if completed task filter is selected.
- Implement authentication using React Router. Create a private route that renders the "UserDashboard" component only if the user is authenticated. Otherwise, redirect the user to the login page.

## Backend (Express.js with MySQL)

### Server Setup
- Set up an Express.js server with MySQL as the database.
- Connect to the database using the appropriate credentials.

### User Management
- Create a "users" table in the database with columns for username and password.
- Implement a signup route to allow users to create an account.
- Implement a login route to handle user authentication. Verify the username and password against the values stored in the "users" table.

### Authentication Middleware
- Add authentication middleware to protect the task endpoints.
- Only authenticated users should be able to access and modify tasks.
